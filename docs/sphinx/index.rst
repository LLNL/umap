UMAP
******

Umap is a library that provides an mmap()-like interface to a simple, user-
space page fault handler based on the userfaultfd Linux feature (starting with
4.3 linux kernel). The use case is to have an application specific buffer of
pages cached from a large file, i.e. out-of-core execution using memory map.
