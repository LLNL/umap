# This script is intended to be run by the bamboo continuous integration
# project definition for UMAP.  It is invoked with the following command
# line arguments:
# $1 - Optionally set to compiler configuration to run
# $2 - Optionally set to -Release or -Debug build ($1 must be set)
#
# BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable may also be set by the bamboo plan
# for locations of dependent libraries (such as CFITS).  This environment
# variable will be tacked on to the end of the cmake build options constructed 
# below.
